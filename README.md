## Tencent Gaming Buddy 2025

Tencent Gaming Buddy is a free gaming platform created by Chinese state-controlled company Tencent that was recently transformed into the GameLoop platform.

Once in the program, you're able to download a number of games from the main interface. It's all rather neatly laid out with a tabbed interface with a selection of available games in a number of categories and the "My Games" tab which lists games which have already been installed.
